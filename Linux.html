  <h2>Other Linux commands</h2>

  <code>
    alias
  </code>

  <p class="">
    Linux includes a large number of commands, but we’ve chosen 37 of the most important ones to present here. Learn
    these commands, and you’ll be much more at home at the Linux command prompt.
    The below list is presented in alphabetical order. A command’s position in the list is not representative of its
    usefulness or simplicity. For the final word on a command’s usage, refer to its man pages. The man command is in our
    list, of course—it’s short for “manual.”
  </p>
  <p class="">
    The alias command lets you give your own name to a command or sequence of commands. You can then type your short
    name, and the shell will execute the command or sequence of commands for you.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l1.png" alt="alias">-->
  <p class="">
    This sets up an alias called cls . It will be another name for clear . When you type cls, it will clear the screen
    just as though you had typed clear . Your alias saves a few keystrokes, sure. But, if you frequently move between
    Windows and Linux command line, you can find yourself typing the Windows cls command on a Linux machine that doesn’t
    know what you mean. Now it will know.

    Aliases can be much more intricate than that simple example. Here’s an alias called pf (for process find) that is
    just a little more complex. Note the use of quotation marks around the command sequence. This is required if the
    command sequence has spaces in it. This alias uses the ps command to list the running processes and then pipes them
    through the grep command. The grep command looks for entries in the output from ps that match the command line
    parameter $1 .
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l2.png" alt="alias">-->
  <p class="">
    Aliases defined on the command line will die with the terminal window. When you close it, they are gone. To make
    your aliases always be available to you, add them to the.bash_aliases file in your home directory.
    <!--    <img class="title-image" src="images/l3.png" alt="alias">-->
  </p>

  <code class="">
    cat
  </code>

  <p class="">
    The alias command lets you give your own name to a command or sequence of commands. You can then type your short
    name, and the shell will execute the command or sequence of commands for you.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l4.png" alt="alias">-->
  <p class="">
    With files longer than the number of lines in your terminal window, the text will whip past too fast for you to
    read. You can pipe the output from cat through less to make the process more manageable. With less you can scroll
    forward and backward through the file using the Up and Down Arrow keys, the PgUp and PgDn keys, and the Home and End
    keys. Type q to quit from less.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l5.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    cd
  </code>
  <p class="">
    The cd command changes your current directory. In other words, it moves you to a new place in the filesystem.
    If you are changing to a directory that is within your current directory, you can simply type cd and the name of the
    other directory.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l1.png" alt="alias">-->
  <p class="">
    Here’s another trick: You can use the double dot symbol .. to represent the parent of the current directory. You can
    type the following command to go up a directory:
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l2.png" alt="alias">-->
  <p class="">
    Aliases defined on the command line will die with the terminal window. When you close it, they are gone. To make
    your aliases always be available to you, add them to the.bash_aliases file in your home directory.
    <!--    <img class="title-image" src="images/l3.png" alt="alias">-->
  </p>


  <code class="">
    chmod
  </code>
  <p class="">
    The chmod command sets the file permissions flags on a file or folder. The flags define who can read, write to or
    execute the file. When you list files with the -l (long format) option you’ll see a string of characters
    If the first character is a - the item is a file, if it is a d the item is a directory. The rest of the string is
    three sets of three characters. From the left, the first three represent the file permissions of the owner, the
    middle three represent the file permissions of the group and the rightmost three characters represent the
    permissions for others. In each set, an r stands for read, a w stands for write, and an x stands for execute.

    If the r, w, or x character is present that file permission is granted. If the letter is not present and a - appears
    instead, that file permission is not granted.

    One way to use chmod is to provide the permissions you wish to give to the owner, group, and others as a 3 digit
    number. The leftmost digit represents the owner. The middle digit represents the group. The rightmost digit
    represents the others. The digits you can use and what they represent are listed here:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      No permission
    </li>
    <li>
      Execute permission
    </li>
    <li>
      Write permission
    </li>
    <li>
      Write and execute permissions
    </li>
    <li>
      Read permission
    </li>
    <li>
      Read and execute permissions
    </li>
    <li>
      Read and write permissions
    </li>
    <li>
      Read, write and execute permissions
    </li>
  </ul>


  <p class="">
    To set the permission to be read, write, and execute (7 from our list) for the owner; read and write (6 from our
    list) for the group; and read and execute (5 from our list) for the others we’d need to use the digits 765 with the
    chmod command:
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l8.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    df


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The df command shows the size, used space, and available space on the mounted filesystems of your computer.

    Two of the most useful options are the -h (human readable) and -x (exclude) options. The human-readable option
    displays the sizes in Mb or Gb instead of in bytes. The exclude option allows you to tell df to discount filesystems
    you are not interested in. For example, the squashfs pseudo-filesystems that are created when you install an
    application with the snap command.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l9.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    diff


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The diff command compares two text files and shows the differences between them. There are many options to tailor
    the display to your requirements.

    The -y (side by side) option shows the line differences side by side. The -w (width) option lets you specify the
    maximum line width to use to avoid wraparound lines. The two files are called alpha1.txt and alpha2.txt in this
    example. The --suppress-common-lines prevents diff from listing the matching lines, letting you focus on the lines
    which have differences.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l10.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    echo


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The echo command can show the value of environment variables, for example, the $USER, $HOME, and $PATH environment
    variables. These hold the values of the name of the user, the user’s home directory, and the path searched for
    matching commands when the user types something on the command line.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l11.png" alt="alias">-->
  <p class="">
    The echo command is also invaluable in shell scripts. A script can use this command to generate visible output to
    indicate the progress or results of the script as it is executed.
  </p>


  <code class="">
    exit


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The exit command will close a terminal window, end the execution of a shell script, or log you out of an SSH remote
    access session.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l12.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    find


  </code>
  <p class="">
    Use the find command to track down files that you know exist if you can’t remember where you put them. You must tell
    find where to start searching from and what it is looking for. In this example, the . matches the current folder and
    the -name option tells find to look for files with a name that matches the search pattern.
  </p>
  <p class="">
    You can use wildcards, where * represents any sequence of characters and ? represents any single character. We’re
    using *ones* to match any file name containing the sequence “ones.” This would match words like bones, stones, and
    lonesome.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l13.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    free


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The free command gives you a summary of the memory usage with your computer. It does this for both the main Random
    Access Memory (RAM) and swap memory. The -h (human) option is used to provide human-friendly numbers and units.
    Without this option, the figures are presented in bytes.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l14.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    head


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The head command gives you a listing of the first 10 lines of a file. If you want to see fewer or more lines, use
    the -n (number) option. In this example, we use head with its default of 10 lines.
  </p>

  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l15.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    ls


  </code>
  <p class="">
    This might be the first command the majority of Linux users meet. It lists the files and folders in the directory
    you specify. By default, ls looks in the current directory. There are a great many options you can use with ls , and
    we strongly advise reviewing its the man page. Some common examples are presented here.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l16.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    mkdir


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The mkdir command allows you to create new directories in the filesystem. You must provide the name of the new
    directory to mkdir. If the new directory is not going to be within the current directory, you must provide the path
    to the new directory.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l17.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    mv


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The mv command allows you to move files and directories from directory to directory. It also allows you to rename
    files.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l18.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    passwd


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The passwd command lets you change the password for a user. Just type passwd to change your own password.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l19.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    pwd


  </code>
  <p class="">
    Nice and simple, the pwd command prints the working directory (the current directory) from the root / directory.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l20.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    shutdown


  </code>
  <p class="">
    The shutdown command lets you shut down or reboot your Linux system.

    Using shutdown with no parameters will shut down your computer in one minute.

  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l21.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="">
    ssh


  </code>
  <p class="">
    Use the ssh command to make a connection to a remote Linux computer and log into your account. To make a connection,
    you must provide your user name and the IP address or domain name of the remote computer. In this example, the user
    mary is logging into the computer at 192.168.4.23. Once the connection is established, she is asked for her
    password.
  </p>
  <!--  <img class="title-image" src="images/l22.png" alt="alias">-->


  <code class="code">
    uname


  </code>
  <p class="">
    You can obtain some system information regarding the Linux computer you’re working on with the uname command.
  </p>
